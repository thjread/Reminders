Use either chrono: https://github.com/wanasit/chrono
or sugar-js: https://sugarjs.com/dates/#/Parsing

Set default forward/future dates, and check specificity to set a default time of day.

Sugar-js: https://github.com/andrewplummer/Sugar/issues/589 to get specificity, maybe need to use a newer version than last release https://github.com/andrewplummer/Sugar/issues/594

Date formatting: either sugar-js or momentjs https://momentjs.com/
